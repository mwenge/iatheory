Iridis Alpha is a classic of the 8-bit home computer era. An innovative,
side-scrolling shoot-em-up for the Commodore 64 that was notable then and now
for its technical accomplishment. This book unpacks the assembly code of the
game and pores over it in minute detail. There are also lots of pretty
pictures.

Work-in-progress is available for free as a [Coming-Along-Nicely Edition](https://github.com/mwenge/iatheory/raw/main/out/iatheory_scrapbook.pdf).

If you'd like to read a hard copy instead you can get the current version from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0C1J2WRCM) at a very reasonable price.

If you like the book, or you are just worried about the author, you can [gift what you want](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/hoganrobert).
