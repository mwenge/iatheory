Work-in-progress is available for free as a [You've-Been-Warned Edition](https://github.com/mwenge/iatheory/raw/main/out/iatheory_scrapbook.pdf).

If you'd like to read a hard copy instead you can get the current version from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0C1J2WRCM) at a very reasonable price.

If you like the book, or just feel sorry for the author, you can [gift what you want](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/hoganrobert).
