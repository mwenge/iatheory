\section{The Byte that Broke}
\begin{q}{Jeff Minter's Newsletter 'The Nature of the Beast' August 1986\cite{planner}}
We must apologise to some of the earliest purchasers of IA, as well... it
seems that some data was corrupted during the production phase of the
data duplication, and the first few hundred copies of the game used to bug
out if you lost at the Bonus Phase All the buggy copies known of have
been replaced, and all current tapes are fine, but if you find you have a
buggy version you should send it back to those awfully nice Hewsons
people and they ll give you an unglitchified one,
\end{q}

What happened is that the master tape had dropped the very last byte in the second
section of game data on the tape.

\section{Reappearing Enemies}

When you start a new game, enemies from the previous game show up in the first
wave. For most people starting out, this will take the form of a few residual
'licker ships' zapping them just as they're getting started.

This bug happens because the 'wave' data isn't cleared down when a new game
starts. So whatever is in there from the previous game gets used until they're
flushed out by being killed and replaced with the level's proper enemy data.

This isn't a problem for the first game after Iridis Alpha is loaded because
the first level's data is hardcoded in there.

The fix is simple enough, we initialize the active wave data stored in `activeShipsWaveDataLoPtrArray` and `activeShipsWaveDataHiPtrArray`
with the first level's data whenever we start a new game. 

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Fixing the reappearing enemy bug]
  LDA #$0F 
  STA $D418    ;Select Filter Mode and Volume 
  JSR ClearPlanetTextureCharsets 
  JSR InitializeActiveShipArray ; Added to fix the bug.

\section{A Sort of Cheat}

After a minute or two in the title screen, the game enters 'Attract Mode' and
plays a random level on autopilot for a few seconds. If you press F1 during
this play you enter the 'Made in France' pause-mode mini game. If you press F1
again you can now start playing the level 'Attract Mode' selected at random.

This is because the `CheckKeyboardInGame` routine doesn't try to prevent you
from entering 'Pause Mode' while Attract Mode is running:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Fixing the reappearing enemy bug]
CheckKeyboardInGame
        LDA lastKeyPressed
        CMP #$40 ; $40 means no key was pressed
        BNE KeyWasPressed
        LDA #$00
        STA f1WasPressed
ReturnEarlyFromKeyboardCheck   
        RTS

KeyWasPressed   
        LDY f1WasPressed
        BNE ReturnEarlyFromKeyboardCheck
        LDY attractModeCountdown
        BEQ b787C
        ; If a key is pressed during attract mode, accelerate the
        ; countdown so that it exits it nearly immediately.
        LDY #$02
        STY attractModeCountdown
\end{lstlisting}
