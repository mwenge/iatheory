\chapter{Preface} 
This book describes the inner workings of a relatively obscure video game created
by an eccentric Englishman in 1986 for the Commodore 64.

If you are curious about old computers such as the C64 or the detailed mechanics
of making a glorified digital breadboard produce something on a screen that flashes, bleeps,
and fascinates then this book is hopefully for you.

The version you are reading is little more than a scrapbook still many revisions away from a
finished product. If you find the writing hard going or the attempts to explain things difficult
to follow, by all means \href{https://github.com/mwenge/iatheory/issues}{\textcolor{blue}{leave me a note}} and
I will gratefully accept your complaint. In the meantime, please skip over any infelicities
to the next pretty picture or promising-looking block of text.
